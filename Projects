Project-09

         In the Bash script, write a program that gets the raw output logs that exist at URL https://coderbyte.com/api/challenges/logs/web-logs-raw. The logs there are a sample of real web server logs. Each line begins with a date, e.g. Apr 10 11:17:35. Your program should do the following:
         Loop through each log item, and find the lines that contain the string coderbyte heroku/router. For each of those, echo the request_id value to a new line, and if the fwd key has the value of MASKED, then add a [M] to the end of the line with a space before it. Your final output should look something like the following:

         b19a87a1-1bbb-000-00000
         b19a87a1-1bbb-000-11111
         8bb2413c-3c67-4180-22222 [M]
